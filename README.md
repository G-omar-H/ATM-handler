# ATM Handler
## üìñ Project Overview

The ATM Handler is a robust system designed to manage and automate the electronic events of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). It provides real-time monitoring through socket connections, ensuring that ATM transactions and error events are logged and handled efficiently. This project aims to optimize ATM performance and reliability, making it a crucial tool for institutions managing large ATM networks.

This handler is part of a broader set of tools within the ALX Software Engineering Programme, showcasing practical skills in real-time systems, event-driven programming, and Docker-based deployment.
## ‚ú® Key Features

    Real-Time Socket Communication: The system listens for events directly from ATMs, providing up-to-the-minute updates on transactions and operations.
    Comprehensive Event Logging: ATM events (e.g., withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, machine malfunctions) are captured and logged in a database for auditing and performance monitoring.
    Automated Event Handling: Leveraging automation, the system can trigger specific responses to critical ATM events, such as system restarts, notifications to maintenance teams, or alerts to operators.
    Docker Deployment: The application is containerized using Docker, allowing for simple deployment, scalability, and consistent environments across development and production.
    Modular Design: Built with scalability in mind, the handler can be easily extended to integrate additional features such as predictive maintenance and data analytics.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular architecture that separates concerns, ensuring scalability and maintainability:

    Socket Listener Module: Listens for incoming ATM events via secure sockets.
    Event Logger: Captures and stores events in a structured format, allowing for easy querying and analysis.
    Automated Response Module: Preconfigured rules and triggers for responding to specific events, such as maintenance or transaction errors.
    Deployment Scripts: Docker scripts that handle containerization and deployment on various platforms.
    Redis Integration: Used as a fast, in-memory data store to handle real-time event queues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

    Programming Language: Python 3.9+
    Containerization: Docker
    In-Memory Storage: Redis
    Database: PostgreSQL (or any SQL database of choice)
    Socket Programming: Python‚Äôs socket library
    Orchestration: Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications

## üöÄ Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.9 or higher
    Docker and Docker Compose
    Redis (optional, but recommended)

Step-by-Step Installation

    Clone the repository:

   ``` bash

git clone https://github.com/G-omar-H/ATM-handler.git
cd ATM-handler
```

Set up a virtual environment:

``` bash

python3 -m venv my_atm_env
source my_atm_env/bin/activate
```

Install project dependencies:

``` bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure environment variables: Rename .env.example to .env and configure your settings:

    REDIS_HOST: Redis server address
    REDIS_PORT: Redis port number
    DB_URI: Database connection string

Run the application with Docker Compose:

``` bash

docker-compose up --build
```

Check the logs:

```bash

docker logs -f atm-handler
```

Stop the application:

``` bash

    docker-compose down
```

üíª Usage

    Start Monitoring ATMs: Once the system is running, it will automatically start listening for ATM events.
    View Event Logs: Access logs via the logs directory or query the database directly for event history.
    Automation: Set up triggers and alerts based on event types to automatically handle ATM malfunctions or errors.

üîÑ Event Types

The system currently handles the following ATM events:

    Cash Withdrawal Events
    Deposit Events
    Balance Inquiry
    Error Handling (e.g., out of service, maintenance required)
    Hardware Failure Reports

Future versions will include predictive analysis and machine learning integrations to preemptively identify potential failures.
